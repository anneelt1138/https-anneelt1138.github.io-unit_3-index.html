	<p>At Tea Co we offer the highest quality teas available as well as delivering innovative blends and natural flavors. The taste, aroma, character, and quality is promised to be the best.
</p>
	<p>To maintain the highest quality and keeping true to our promise to carefully control our production processes we only buy from tea farms that understand our needs and only provide the highest quality teas leaves.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The country and/or region grown.</li>
	<li>Method of production</li>
	<li>Soil conditions</li>
	<li>Climate conditions</li>
